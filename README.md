## Program Overview

The **Stanford Deep Learning Portal (DLP)** is a highly selective program that provides undergraduate students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, with direct mentorship from Stanford deep learning experts. The program aims to lower the barriers to entry in AI/ML by offering practical, hands-on guidance through foundational deep learning courses.

I participated in the **Image Recognition Track**, where I learned to apply deep learning techniques to solve real-world computer vision problems. Throughout the program, I completed projects that covered key deep learning concepts, with close guidance from Stanford mentors.

## Key Program Components

- **Course Assistance**: Guided through the **Deep Learning Specialization** on Coursera, covering the foundations of neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning.
- **General Advising**: Mentorship sessions and fireside chats with Stanford faculty and PhD students offering insights into AI careers and academic paths.
- **Deep Learning Network**: Built a network of fellow students and deep learning specialists to continue collaborating beyond the program.

## Curriculum Highlights

### Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera)
I completed the following key modules:
- **Foundations of Deep Learning**: Neural network basics, shallow and deep neural networks, and practical aspects of deep learning.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Object detection, image segmentation, face recognition, and transfer learning.
- **Advanced Topics**: Hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and optimization algorithms.

### Image Recognition Track Projects
- **Convolutional Models**: Built a CNN from scratch and applied it to classify images using **TensorFlow**.
- **Transfer Learning with MobileNet**: Fine-tuned a pre-trained MobileNet model for specific image recognition tasks.
- **YOLO for Object Detection**: Applied the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model for real-time object detection.

## Mentors and Team
I was fortunate to work with highly skilled mentors from Stanfordâ€™s CS department, including:
- **Moo Jin Kim**: Founder and Mentor
- **Percy Liang**: Faculty Advisor
- **Ahmed Ahmed**: Strategic Advisor

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Deep Learning Models**: CNNs, YOLO, MobileNet

## Image Recognition Track Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Neural network foundations, shallow vs. deep networks.
- **Week 3-5**: Convolutional neural networks, regularization, optimization methods.
- **Week 6-10**: Transfer learning, real-time object detection with YOLO, advanced applications like face recognition and style transfer.

## Program Impact

Through the DLP, I developed a deeper understanding of deep learning techniques, built lasting connections with mentors from Stanford, and enhanced my AI/ML skillset. This experience provided me with practical knowledge and project-based learning to excel in future AI/ML projects.
